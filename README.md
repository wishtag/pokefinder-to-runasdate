# PokéFinder to RunAsDate
A pretty simple python script that takes a date and time from [PokéFinder](https://github.com/Admiral-Fish/PokeFinder) and enters it into [RunAsDate](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/run_as_date.html) for you  
# Usage
Step 1. Pick one of the Date/Times from the available options

Step 2. Highlight Date/Time

Step 3. Press ctrl + c  
Step 4. Start the program (if you haven't already) and paste what you copied  
Step 5. You'll then be prompted to either cancel or proceed  
Step 6. Assuming you proceed, the program will then tell you to focus on the month is RunAsDate, giving you 3 seconds to do so before it starts typing.

And thats pretty much all there is to it.
